SOLUTION:  *** IF OIL PRESSURE LIGHT *** 
Answer: If you Oil Pressure Indicator is on, it is possible that your engine does not have enough oil in it. Engine oil should be changed 3-6 months or between 3,000 to 5,000 miles (depends on the quality of oil used). Check your oil level first using the dip stick on your engine bay, if the oil level is below the dots of the stick, we are sure that your engine needs to change its oil. Remember to use the quality of oil needed for your car as stated to your user's manual. Changing it's viscosity might not be good to your engine. If ever your oil and oil filter has been changed and the oil indicator light is still visible, let the mechanic check your air filter if it is clogged or there is too much dirt in it. If it is still new and usable, your mechanic just need to remove the dirt on the air filter by using vaccuum or air spray. If the light is still on, let your mechanic finally check if your oil gauge is faulty or not. After all has been checked and your indicator is working properly, there might be a small chance that your car has engine wear due to misuse or not maintaining your oil properly which can case to reducing oil pressure in your engine. To avoid it, make sure to have your engine oil and oil filter changed regularly at a proper period and proper way and dont stay too long at a lower gear at high rpm range as it can cause a lot of wear and overheating on your engine. 

SOLUTION:  *** IF ENGINE TEMPERATURE LIGHT ***
Answer: If you see this indicator lights up, it means that your engine is overheating. It could be for a couple of reasons. First is that you're staying in lower gear at higher rpm which is too much stress for the engine and can cause overheating. Second would be your coolant, it is important to check your coolant level everytime before you use your vehicle to avoid overheating in the middle of the road. If your coolant level is low than the indicator on its resevoir, check if there is any leak below your engine bay. If there is no leak and your coolant is losing more, have your mechanic check your engine if the coolant is getting inside your engine which is a big problem as it can damage your engine and shorten its life span. Having coolant inside the engine could be caused by headgaskets so make sure that your mechanic will check your headgasket upon opening your engine. 

SOLUTION:  *** IF ABS LIGHT ***
Answer: If this indicator light lights up shortly when you break suddenly during your trip, it is normal as it means that it serves its purpose. But if it lights up even when your car is on idle, it could mean that there is something wrong with the system. It is best to have your car checked by the dealership. Make sure to ask your insurance company to have your car towed back to the dealership as it is dangerous to drive it especially if your dealership is not near to your location. 

SOLUTION:  *** IF HANDBRAKE/PARKING BRAKE LIGHT ***
Answer: If parking brake indicator lights up, make sure to check if you dis-enganged it properly. If you are sure that your parking brake is dis-engaged properly, it means that you need to add brake fluid in your reservoir. Check your brake fluid level on the engine bay. Most modern cars doesnt lose brake fluid so check if there is any leak in your brake fluid hose. Also check your brake pads if it's still in good condition and thick. Worn-out brake pads could make your brake fluid reservoir look less, but once you replaced your brake pads with brand new ones, it will return to its proper fluid level. 

SOLUTION:  *** IF TRACTION CONTROL LIGHT ***
Answer: If Traction control indicator lights up, it tells you that your vehicle's traction control system might have a broken or damaged sensor or some other malfunction. There are some cars that there is the same control module that operates your ABS and traction control system, so the light sometimes comes on when there is also a problem with your ABS. Make sure to let your dealership handle this systems as they have specialist for this type of problems. 

SOLUTION:  *** IF ENGINE WARNING LIGHT ***
Answer: If your Engine warning light is on, it could mean variety of reasons. It can indicate a serious issue and requires you to stop your car immidiately if the indicator is flashing. Try to check if your gas cap is properly closed. If light is still on, we suggest for the most accurate result to let your trusted mechanic do a scan tool to precisely point out where is the root of the problem. Most of the modern scan tool used by professional mechanics have accurate results and points out which part of the engine needs service. 

SOLUTION:  *** BATTERY ALERT LIGHT ***
Answer: If your Battery indicator light is on, it tells you that there is an issue with the vehicle's charging system. Sometimes, its not your battery's fault here are some reasons: you might have a loose or damaged battery cable, your alternator or alternator belt is broken. If it is your battery at fault, you'll notice that occassionally, your clock or center display are dimming and there would be times that your car will have hard time to start. If your car suddenly dies in the middle of the road and battery indicator lights up, try to inform other drivers about your situation and have your battery jumped by their battery so you can start your car again and bring it home or have it serviced by your trusted mechanic. Upon getting to your service shop, have them check your battery status if it can be charged again or it needs replacement. Most battery last 2-5 years depending on how you use your car. Take note that you have to install the right battery type and size for your car for the most efficient performance. Refer to your owners manual for what type of battery is compatible to your car. 

SOLUTION:  *** TIRE PRESSURE LIGHT ***
Answer: If your Tire Pressure light is on, try to find gas stations that has air machines available. It means that your tire pressure is too low or too high and needs to be addressed. It is unsafe to to drive with too low or too high air pressure. Most sedans, SUV's and pick ups have between 30-35 psi of air each tire. Take note to put the right tire pressure on your tires and refer to your owner's manual if you're not sure. 

SOLUTION:  *** FUEL INDICATOR *** 
Answer: If your Fuel indicator light is on, it simply means that your too low on fuel! So make sure to gas up again and dont make it a habit on running in too low fuel as your fuel pump might suck air which can cause damage on your fuel system. Always make sure your car is running enough fuel everytime you use it. 

SOLUTION:  *** AIR BAG INDICATOR ***
Answer: If your Airbag indicator light is on, it signals that something is wrong with one of your airbags or the system as a whole. Your airbags keep you safe during accidents, so it's as important as your engine too. Make sure to address this issue immidiately by your dealership as this is covered by your warranty or insurance. 

SOLUTION:  *** SEAT BELT REMINDER ***
Answer: This indicator reminds you to use your seatbelt. It is just a safety measure for you and your passenger. If the light doenst turn off even if seatbelt is already used, let the mechanic check the wiring or module of your seatbelt indicator. 

SOLUTION:  *** WASHER FLUID INDICATOR ***
Answer: This indicator reminds you to re-fill your window washer fluid. It is important to always check the level of your washer fluid as it will always help you if there is a dirt on your glass. Remember to always used distilled water or original washer fluid to ensure that there is no unwanted minerals that might cause corrosion inside the tubing in the long run.

A.  *** IF NO ****



Q.  If no indicator light is on, what can you feel/see about your car?

* Hearing Engine knock
* Steering Wheel is shaking while at motion
* Squeking/Grinding noise when breaking
* Steering feels heavy
* RPM goes up faster but the car wont accelerate
* Car is consuming too much oil
* Battery is not charging (even if its a newly replaced battery)
* Radiator Leaking
* Turning the key and nothing happens
* Too much smoke from exhaust
* Consuming too much fuel and strong gas odor
* When changing gear, it wont engage easily or it wont stay in gear (Note: Applies to Manual Transmission) 
* Fluid is leaking in the differential part 
* Grinding noise when steering and hard to steer
* Decreasing gas mileage and you feel loss of power. 



SOLUTION:  *** Hearing Engine Knock ***
Q.  *** Does the knocking sound becomes louder and faster as you accelerate?  (Y/N)
  IF YES - Engine Knock +1
  IF NO -  Engine Knock +0
Q.  *** Do you use the proper Octane level of petrol for your car? 
  IF YES - Engine Knock +0
  IF NO  - Engine Knock +1
Q.  *** How old is your current Sparkplugs?
  * New (Below 10,000km) - Engine Knock +0
  * 10,001 - 25,000km    - Engine Knock +1
  * 25,001 - 40,000km    - Engine Knock +2

SOLUTION:  IF ENGINE KNOCK SCORE = 0 
    - You're engine might not have detonation (incorrect Air/Fuel Mixture) but you might have another problem causing knocking sound like Rod Knock. As you Pistons travel up and down in the engine, they turn the crankshaft which ultimately sends power to the wheels. The Rod bearings facilitate smooth pistons movement, but if they are worn out, the pistons will start to rattle against the crankshaft which creates a very similar knocking sound. Have your mechanic check the bearings or other work done on the postons and crankshaft. This could be a long repair to do and also expensive. To avoid it from happening again, make sure to: (1) Change your oil filter regularly with your new oil. (2) Wait for the oil to travel throughout the engine (modern cars takes 5-10 seconds) unless emergency. (3) Clean your fuel-injectors regularly by filling your gas tank with fuel-injector cleaner every 2,000km.  Note: Those are just preventive measures and will not asure that your engine wont have knock problems, but the risk of having knock will be decreased. 

TO DO LIST: 
* Have your Air/Fuel mixture scanned if its still correct
* Have your engine bearings,pistons, crankshaft checked 
* Dont rev the engine high at first start

SOLUTION:  IF ENGINE KNOCK SCORE = 1-4
    - You're engine might been experiencing detonation where the Air/Fuel mixture is not balanced. More air than fuel means your engine is having Lean Mixture, while having more fuel than air means that your engine is having Rich Mixture. Changing your Sparkplugs every after 30,000km is a must in order to avoid these kinds of problems. The sparkplugs is the one responsible for igniting the fuel in your cylinders, if the sparkplugs are worned or dirty then it wont function very well. Also, the octane level of your fuel is very important. Make sure to follow the recommended octane level for your car, you can go higher than the recommended octane level, but you cannot go below. Make sure that the fuel you filled into your car is clean by only filling your car into your trusted station. To fix this, your mechanic might replace your sparkplugs and tune your car for the right air/fuel mixture. Have your car scanned by their scan tool to find more accurate result about your air/fuel mixture. To avoid it from happening again, make sure to: (1) Change your Sparkplugs every after 30,000km (2) Use the recommended octane for your car or higher. (3) Use only clean fuel by refilling with your trusted station. Note: Those are just preventive measures and will not asure that your engine wont have knock problems, but the risk of having knock will be decreased. 

TO DO LIST: 
* Check and change Sparkplugs if needed
* Refuel with recommended octane level
* Regularly change your oil

SOLUTION:  *** Steering Wheel is Shaking while at motion *** 
  - If youre steering wheel shakes while driving, it is either you have damaged suspension components or wheel bearings are loose. Have your car suspension checked if there is any damage or leak. Also have your wheel parts checked, mainly (1) balljoints (2) wheel balance (3) wheel alignment. To avoid having damaged suspension, ball joints and misaligned wheels, always be gentle on rough roads or humps even if you have a good suspension set. Driving it gently through rough surfaces will prevent your parts from having unecessary shock load. Also, always check your tire pressure, use the recommended tire pressure for your car and always check if there is any leak on the suspension before having long drive to avoid accidents. 

TO DO LIST:
* Fill your tires with proper tire pressure
* Do a wheel balancing and alignment 
* Check balljoints 


SOLUTION:  *** Squeaking/Grinding Noise when Braking *** 
  - The grinding noise you hear everytime you press the brake pedal will only be due to your brake system. Check the brake fluid level under your hood, if it is below the line level, it gives you a sign that you need to replace a new brake pad set for your car. The grinding noise and the fluid level is the physical indicator that your brake pads needs to be changed. Also, have your drum breaks pads (if there is) replaced because it wears too with your front brakes and you'll need it for better park brake grip. Always check your brake rotors if its too thin, the mechanic will recommend you to also replace it, but it usually takes a long time before it wears out. 

TO DO LIST: 
* Check brake fluid level
* Change brake pads (Also brake rotors if necessary) 


SOLUTION:  *** Steering Feels Heavy ***
   - There is only two things you need to check if your steering wheel feels hard or heavy to rotate than usual. First, check your tires for any punctures or if there is a flat tire. If there is no any puncture or damage to the tires, have your steering fluid checked if there is a leak or it is too dirty. Dirty steering fluid causes noise when steering and makes it hard for the steering process. Have your steering fluid flushed and replaced by your trusted mechanic or do it yourself if you know the process. 

TO DO LIST: 
* Check for tire damages
* Check steering fluid condition
* Flush and replace steering fluid if dirty

SOLUTION:  *** RPM goes up but wont accelerate ***

   - If you run your car and the RPM gauge goes up high but your car wont accelerate or pull, it tells you that your clutch system is already bad. If you smell something like burning rubber in your car, the problem is your clutch. Bring your car to your trusted mechanic and have your clutch set replaced. It usually includes Pressure Plate, Driven Plate and the release bearing. It is pretty expensive but if you replaced it early, it wont damage your transmission. To prolong the life of your clutch system, avoid pressing the clutch when you're in a stop for a long period of time. Also, use the proper gear for proper places. Example is when you're in an uphill, use lower gears like 1st gear or 2nd gear depending on your speed (Applicable to manual transmission).

* Check the clutch components
* Replace the clutch set if already worned out
* Avoid pressing clutch for too long


SOLUTION:  *** Car is consuming too much oil *** 

    - Recheck your oil stick when the car has been idle for a couple of hours or more. If the oil level is below the indicator, check if there is any sign of leak underneath the oil cap or filter (if under). If there is no leakage, then there is nothing to fix but it means that you need to change your oil. Always try to use a high quality oil or atleast the recommended oil from your car manufacturer and use the recommended viscosity base on your owner's manual. Using poor quality oil will corrode your engine and will not properly coat and cool your engine which cause it to easily burn. 

TO DO LIST
* Check for any oil leaks
* Change your oil regularly every 5,000 - 10,000 km
* Use the recommended oil viscosity and level

SOLUTION:  *** Battery Not Charging *** 
    - This is a sign that your alternator is failing. Your alternator charges your battery while your car is running. Have your alternator checked if it can still be fixed or replaced. To avoid having issues while on a long trip, always have a voltmeter that monitors if your battery is being charged by your alternator. 

TO DO LIST: 
* Have your alternator checked if it can be fixed or must be replaced
* Have voltmeter for monitoring the charging status of battery

SOLUTION:  *** Fluid Leaking from Radiator *** 
    - If you are sure that the fluid is leaking from the radiator and not from the aircon, check the leaked fluid if its the same as your antifreeze, if not and its like a water only, then it's only from the aircon which is normal. But if it's the same texture and smell like your antifreeze, have your radiator replaced immidiately. It can cause overheating and worst, an engine fire. Have your coolant flushed and replaced by new one. Always check if there is uncommon leaks from your car before going for a trip. 

TO DO LIST: 
* Check of the fluid is the same with your antifreeze coolant
* If radiator is broken, replace it with the original one from your manufacturer

SOLUTION:  *** Turning the key and car wont even crank or start ***
     - If you turn your key and you hear a loud solid click noise, then you most likely have a faulty starter motor. Have your starter motor checked by your professional mechanic and the reason why it failed. A starter motor is not needed to be replaced, but once it failed and can't be fixed, it is necessary to replace it. Keeping your battery terminals clean always will help you avoid having starter problems. 

TO DO LIST: 
* Have your starter motor checked 
* Test it 5-10 times after being fixed 



SOLUTION:  *** Too much smoke from exhaust *** 
    - The emission system is designed to keep pollution to a minimum while making sure your car runs properly. The system includes a lot of sensitive equipment that can fail from time to time and these cause a variety of different problems in the car. For example, an O2 sensor that is faulty may start affecting the fuel mixture, leading to inefficiencies in the running and economy of the vehicle. Have your exhaust system checked if there is any components that causes too much emissions. If everything is good, have your car scanned by your mechanic's scan tool to monitor the air-fuel mixture because your car might be running rich, which means more fuel is being wasted than necessary which is responsible for too much smoke emitting on your exhaust. 

TO DO LIST: 
* Check for any damage on the exhaust system
* Have your air/fuel mixture checekd using scan tool
* Regularly change your oil every 5,000 - 10,000km


SOLUTION:  *** When changing gear, it wont engage easily or it wont stay in gear ***
    - This is a sign that there is a problem with your gearbox or clutch system. Have your clutch checked first because its easier to replace clutch set than to have your transmission or gearbox to be parted out. If your clutch is still good, then thats the time to have your gearbox or transmission system checked. To avoid having problems with your transmission, replace your transmission fluid every 35,000 to 45,000km and make sure to use the proper viscosity and enough liters needed. Having your transmission fluid maintained properly is cheaper than fixing your transmission. 

TO DO LIST: 
* Check clutch first if there is any wear or damage
* If clutch is'nt the problem, you need to let them check your transmission or gearbox for damage
* Change transmission fluid every 35,000 to 45,000km


SOLUTION:  *** Fluid is leaking in the differential part *** 
    - You're differential is part of your transmission system. Leaking fluid from differential is most likely your transmission fluid. Check carefully if its really the fluid from your transmission or just water from your AC. If its your transmission fluid, have your car serviced and let your mechanic do whatever he can to fix the hole where the leak is coming from. Also, have your transmission fluid changed after the fix. To avoid having cracked oil pan, always clean your underchassis every after you use your vehicle on rainy days especially when you run to a flood. It can cause corrosion overtime so you must clean your underchassis too, plus you can also see if there is any existing problems underneath. 

TO DO LIST: 
* Check if the fluid is really your transmission fluid
* If the hole exist, have it fixed immidiately and change new transmission fluid 
* Regularly clean your underchassis and check for cracks or leaks



SOLUTION:  *** Grinding noise when steering and hard to steer ***
    - If you find your car difficult to steer, make sure first that your steering fluid is on enough level and your tires have not flat. If there is a leakage on steering fluid  and accompanied by grinding noise when you steer your steering wheel, it is a sign that you have a bad or failing steering rack. Steering rack is the most vital part in your steering system. It is necessary to have your steering rack fixed immidiately because its extremely dangerous to drive with broken steering. Your steering rack will be replaced as its too expensive and hard to repair one. You also dont want to risk having another failure again so its better to replace it with new ones. 

TO DO LIST:
* Check if there is any damage on tires
* Check steering fluid if for any leaks.
* Have your steering rack checked for any damage


SOLUTION:  *** Decreasing gas mileage and you feel loss of power *** 
    - There could be many reasons why you feel the excessive consuming of fuel and loss of power but the most basic thing we tend to forget is checking the air filter. If your air filter is clogged and dirty, you'll surely feel the loss of power while having huge fuel consumption unlike when its new. Check your air filter if its still clean and there is no clogged on the vents where the air pass through. If it's too dirty, replace it with the new one and make sure its the same and original from your manufacturer to avoid any more issues. You should change your air filter every after 25,000-30,000km or atleast once every 2 years. It is also a good idea to change your cabin filter together with your engine air filter. Cabin filter is the filter for your aircon and its necessary to replace it regularly because it keeps your air clean inside your car. 

TO DO LIST: 
* Check air filter and air filter box for any clogging
* Replace air filter and cabin filter with original one from manufacturer if needed
* Replace air filter every after 25,000 to 30,000 km
